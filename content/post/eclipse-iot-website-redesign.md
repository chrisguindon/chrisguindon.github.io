We are launching the redesign of the [Eclipse IoT](https://iot.eclipse.org) website today! This project was a [huge undertaking](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/pull/339) for us; we added 5,245 lines of code, removed 82,361 lines of code, closed [15 github issues](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/projects/3) and made 84 git commits.

Yes, you got that right, the end result is -77116 lines of code since we took the opportunity to clean up some of the source code. 

When we started this project, we set out some [goals](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/issues/179) for the new redesign:

1. **Improve our information architecture:** \
With the help of [Frédéric Desbiens](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/fdesbiens), the community created a new [structure](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/files/3591212/iot.eclipse.org.new.structure.v2.pdf) for the website.

2. **Contribute to the recruitment of new members and adopters** \
Adopters and members are now top level menu items. We also created a new “[How to be Listed as an Adopter](https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/how-to-be-listed-as-an-adopter/)” page.

3. **Ensure the website cathers to both technical and non-technical visitors** \
We made some improvements to our [community](https://iot.eclipse.org/community/) and [resources](https://iot.eclipse.org/community/resources/) sections. These sections cathers to both technical and non-technical users since you can find Case-Studies, Market Reports, Video, Whitepapers and many more resources to keep you informed about Eclipse IoT.

4. **Drive adoption for our technologies** \
Our old static project data file was replaced by a new script that retrieves up-to-date project data from the [Eclipse PMI](https://projects.eclipse.org). Going forward, each time we publish a change to the website, the information on our [Projects](https://iot.eclipse.org/projects) page will be updated.

We do our best to work in an open and transparent way. We started this project by creating a [Github Project](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/projects/3) with [two milestones](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/milestones) to help us achieve our launch deadline of March 24, 2020.

We do this to keep our communities up-to-date with our efforts and it’s a great way for us to collaborate and share tasks. As the project manager, this was a great way to make sure that the project was moving forward as planned.

We also created a set of  [brand guidelines](https://www.eclipse.org/artwork/zip_file_v2/Eclipse-IoT-Brand-Guidelines.pdf)  for the Eclipse IoT Working Group. These guidelines include the brand font (Roboto), logo variations, color swatches, and acceptable logo treatments. This will help us consistently deploy the brand across different digital and print channels as well as Eclipse IoT events. 

Overall, I am very happy with this new redesign! A huge thank you to [Eric Poirier](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/epoirier), [Matt Joanisse](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/mjoanisse4m4), a graphic designer hired by the Foundation to work on the site, [Christie Witt](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/cwitt), [Joe Speed](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/jspeedn7e),  [Frédéric Desbiens](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/fdesbiens) and [Martin Lowe](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/malowe)!
