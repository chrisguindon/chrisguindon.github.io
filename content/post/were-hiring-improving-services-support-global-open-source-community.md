The Eclipse Foundation supports a global open source community by providing trusted platforms, services, and governance. As a vendor-neutral organisation, we operate infrastructure that enables collaboration across projects, organisations, and industries.

These platforms and services support project governance, developer tooling, and day-to-day operations across the Eclipse ecosystem. Much of this infrastructure runs quietly in the background, but it plays a critical role in the health, security, and sustainability of open source projects.

We are expanding the Software Development team with two new roles. Both positions involve contributing to the design, development, and operation of services that are widely used, security-sensitive, and expected to operate reliably at scale.

## Software engineer: security and detection

One of the roles is a Software Engineer position with a focus on security and detection engineering, alongside general service development and operations.

This role will work on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/), an open source registry for VS Code extensions operated by the Eclipse Foundation. As adoption grows across multiple development environments, maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the registry requires continuous analysis, detection, and operational safeguards.

In this role, you will:

* Analyse suspicious or malicious extensions and related artefacts
* Develop, test, and maintain YARA rules to detect malicious or policy-violating content
* Design and implement improvements to backend services, including new features, abuse prevention, rate-limiting, and operational safeguards

This is hands-on work that combines backend development with practical security analysis. The outcome directly improves the reliability, integrity, and operation of services that are part of the developer tooling supply chain.

For additional context on the problems this role addresses, see my recent post on [strengthening supply-chain security in Open VSX](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/christopher-guindon/strengthening-supply-chain-security-open-vsx).

## Software developer: open source project tooling and services

The second role is a Software Developer position focused on improving the tools and services that support Eclipse open source projects.

This work centres on maintaining and evolving systems that our open source projects and contributors rely on every day. It includes:

* Maintaining and modernising project-facing applications such as projects.eclipse.org, built with Drupal and PHP
* Developing Python tooling to automate internal processes and improve project metrics
* Improving services written in Java or JavaScript that support project governance workflows

As with the Software Engineer role, this position involves contributing to production services. The focus is on incremental improvement, reducing technical debt, and ensuring systems remain maintainable, secure, and reliable as they evolve.

## What we are looking for

Across both roles, we are looking for people who:

* Take a pragmatic approach to problem solving
* Are comfortable working in a remote, open source environment
* Value clear documentation and thoughtful communication
* Enjoy understanding how systems work and how to improve them over time

If you are interested in working on open source infrastructure with real users and real impact, we would be happy to hear from you.
