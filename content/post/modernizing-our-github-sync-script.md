I am happy to announce that my team is ready to deploy a new version of our [GitHub Sync Toolset](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-github-sync) on November 26, 2019 from 10:00 to 11:00 am EST.

We are not expecting any disruption of service but it's possible that some committers may lose write access to their Eclipse project GitHub repositories during this 1 hour maintenance window.

This toolset is responsible for syncronizing Eclipse committers accross all our GitHub repositories and on top of that, this new release will start syncronizing contributors. 

In this context, a contributor is a GitHub user with read access to the project GitHub repositories. This new feature will allow committers to assign issues to contributors who currently don't have write access to the repository. This feature was requested in 2015 via [Bug 483563](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=483563) - Allow assignment of GitHub issues to contributors.

Eclipse Committers are reponsible for maintaining a list of GitHub contributors from their [project](https://projects.eclipse.org/) page on the Eclipse Project Management Infrastructure (PMI). 

To become an Eclipse contributor on a GitHub for a project, please make sure to tell us your **GitHub Username** in your [Eclipse account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/edit).
