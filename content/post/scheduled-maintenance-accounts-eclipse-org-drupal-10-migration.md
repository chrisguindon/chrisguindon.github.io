We're excited to announce that [accounts.eclipse.org](https://accounts.eclipse.org) will migrate from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 on January 19, 2025. This is a significant milestone in our ongoing effort to modernize the Eclipse Foundation’s web infrastructure, following the successful migration of the [Project Management Infrastructure (PMI)](https://projects.eclipse.org/) earlier this year. This migration aligns with our plans that we outlined in last year’s post, [Navigating the Shift From Drupal 7 to Drupal 9/10 at the Eclipse Foundation](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/christopher-guindon/navigating-shift-drupal-7-drupal-10-eclipse-foundation).

To ensure a smooth transition, we’ve scheduled a [maintenance window](https://www.eclipsestatus.io/maintenance/471099) on January 19, 2025, from 02:00 am CET to 06:30 pm CET, during which [accounts.eclipse.org](https://accounts.eclipse.org) will be in read-only mode.

During this period, users will be able to log in and access other Eclipse Foundation websites, such as [projects.eclipse.org](https://projects.eclipse.org), [gitlab.eclipse.org](https://gitlab.eclipse.org), and [marketplace.eclipse.org](https://marketplace.eclipse.org). However, some functionality, such as the profile edit form and the create an account form will be temporarily disabled to prevent data loss while we migrate your profile data to a new database.

We’re excited about this migration and hope it will provide a better user experience for all. If you have any feedback or encounter issues, please visit our [dedicated issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/it/websites/accounts.eclipse.org/-/issues/143), which includes details on how to access the staging environment to preview the changes and how to share feedback with us!
