The Eclipse Foundation recently [announced](https://newsroom.eclipse.org/news/announcements/open-source-software-leader-eclipse-foundation-announces-transition-europe-part) its intention to transition to Europe as part of its continued global expansion. 

To support this initiative, we needed to start making some important changes to our website. This week, we made available the first round of these changes!

### 1. Eclipse Membership

First off, it was essential to rethink how we convey membership information on our website. Our main goal was to organize information effectively and highlight important links such as [how to contact us](https://accounts.eclipse.org/contact/membership). 

We decided to use tabs to make it easier for users to find our [membership fees](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/#tab-fees), our [membership levels](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/#tab-levels), how to [become a member](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/#tab-membership), and our key [services](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/#tab-benefits). 

Folks are no longuer required to naviate between multiple pages to find the information they need.

### 2. Eclipse Working Groups

Given that our new members are now interested in joining an [Eclipse Working Groups](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/explore.php), we wanted to make sure that important documents, such as the Working Group Partipation Agreement or the Working Group Charter, were easy to find. 

Therefore, we thought changing the layout would help. We highlighted the Resources section to make it really visible on the page and now we have more space to grow and support additional documents in the future.

### 3. Eclipse Members

Finally, we simplified our [Members](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php) page, we thought the page would be more interesting by offering a simple list of logos and company name by removing the short description of each member.

## The Work Ahead

Our focus is now on the required content updates for Eclipse Foundation AISBL.

We created [Bug 566455 - Website Updates For Eclipse Foundation AISBL](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566455) to discuss these remaining changes.

One of those changes is to publish the Eclipse Foundation AISBL Membership Agreement. This is a new agreement that members will be asked to sign as of October. To simplify the signing process, we will allow our members to sign the Membership Agreement with an eSignature.

We also need to [update the currency](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566456) of our membership fees. Our fees will no longer be stated in USD but in Euros. 

The list of remaining changes is available via the [dependency tree](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/showdependencytree.cgi?id=566455) of this project.
