Microsoft announced the [retirement of Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11)](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/06/15/internet-explorer-11-has-retired-and-is-officially-out-of-support-what-you-need-to-know/) on June 15, 2022. In alignment with this industry change and our upcoming migration to [Drupal 10](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/browser-requirements) and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/), we are formally announcing that we will cease support for IE 11 effective January 1, 2024.







Our decision to extend support until 2024 is strategic. Based on our website analytics, a small but significant 3% of our user base is still utilizing IE. It's important to note that IE 11 is a legacy browser that is no longer supported by Microsoft, posing increased security risks. We believe this timeline will provide ample opportunity for users to transition to modern, more secure browsers while allowing us to align our technical roadmap. 






## What Does This Mean for You?





For those still using IE 11, we strongly urge you to transition to a modern browser before January 1, 2024. Popular alternatives include Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, all of which offer a more secure and efficient browsing experience.







We understand that this is a significant change, and we want to hear from you. If you have any concerns or objections, please participate in our [discussion](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/1476).




While we aim to be as inclusive as possible in terms of browser support, technological advancements necessitate this inevitable shift. We believe that by giving our community advance notice, we're ensuring a smoother transition for everyone involved.
