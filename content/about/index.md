I am a technology leader with over 17 years of experience in all stages of the software and web development cycle. In addition to my technical skills, I have strong experience managing teams of developers and contractors, making sure projects are delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest quality standards.

As **Director of Software Development** at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/staff.php), I provide leadership across all of the Foundation’s software development activities, including open-source product development, AI adoption, and regulatory compliance.

I started my software development journey in the mid-90s when I was 12 years old. I learned HTML to build a French video game review website and quickly discovered my passion for technology. I’ve always been a bit of a perfectionist, and I think that’s one of the reasons I love the job so much. At the Eclipse Foundation, I get the chance to work with incredibly talented people on exciting projects. Even after more than a decade, no two days feel the same. I also enjoy creating side projects just to learn and experiment with new technologies.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the drums, watching sports, golfing, and video games. I’m also very passionate about music and live concerts.
