With over 16 years of experience in web development, I am a highly skilled professional who excels in all stages of the development cycle. Not only do I possess technical expertise, but I also have extensive experience managing teams of developers, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards.

As a passionate and dedicated developer, I pride myself on my strong analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills, which enable me to identify and resolve issues quickly and effectively.

I began my web design journey in the mid-90s when I was just 12 years old. I learned HTML to build a French video game review website and discovered my passion for web development. My love for the job only grew stronger over the years as I realized my perfectionist tendencies, which has helped me excel in my role at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/staff.php). Working with talented and intelligent people on exciting projects for over eleven years, I have never done the same thing twice. In fact, I frequently take on random projects just to learn new technologies.

Outside of work, I love playing the drums, watching hockey, playing video games, or hitting the slopes (snowboarding). I am also very passionate about music and live concerts.
