I am a highly skilled web developer with over 16 years of experience in all stages of the development cycle for web projects. In addition to my technical expertise, I also have extensive experience managing teams of developers, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards. 

As a passionate and dedicated employee, I have strong analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills, which enable me to identify and resolve issues quickly and effectively.

I began my web developer journey in the mid-90s when I was just 12 years old. I learned HTML to build a French video game review website and discovered my passion for web development. I quickly learned that I am a bit of a perfectionist and I believe that's one of the reasons I got hooked on my job at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/staff.php). Everyday, I get the opportunity to work with some very talented and intelligent people on super cool projects. After more than eleven years on the job I don't think I've done the same thing twice. I often create random projects just to learn new technologies.

Outside of work, I love playing the drums, watching hockey, playing video games, or hitting the slopes. I am also very passionate about music and live concerts.
