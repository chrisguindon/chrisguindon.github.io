I am a highly skilled web developer with over 16 years of experience in all stages of the development cycle for web projects. In addition to my technical expertise, I also have extensive experience managing teams of developers, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards. 

As a passionate and dedicated employee, I have strong analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills, which enable me to identify and resolve issues quickly and effectively.

I have been involved in web design since the mid-90's. At 12 years old I was learning HTML to build a french video game review website. This is when my passion for web development started.

I quickly learned that I am a bit of a perfectionist and I believe that's the reason I got hooked on my job at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/staff.php). I get the opportunity to work with some very talented and smart people on super cool projects. After more than 8 years on the job I don't think I've done the same thing twice. I often create random projects just to learn new technologies.

When I am not at a computer, which is rare, I spend my time playing the drums, watching hockey, playing video games or at the top of a hill snowboarding.

I am also very passionate about music and live concerts.
