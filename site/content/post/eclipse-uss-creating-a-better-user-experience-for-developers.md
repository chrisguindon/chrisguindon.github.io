Presented by Antoine Thomas & Christopher Guindon.

Eclipse projects often need to maintain user data or state information that can persist across multiple computers or workspaces. The Eclipse User Storage Service (USS) is here to help solve this problem. 

The Eclipse USS is a new storage service from the Eclipse Foundation, that allows projects to store and retrieve user data and preferences from our servers.
