## Requirements
* [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)
* [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator. This means that, unlike systems like WordPress, Ghost and Drupal, which run on your web server expensively building a page every time a visitor requests one, Hugo does the building when you create your content.

#### How to install

Please refer to the [Installing Hugo](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) documentation.

### What is Node.js
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. 

#### How to install

You can install a pre-built version of node.js via the [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/).

## How to build

```shell
git clone git@github.com:chrisguindon/chrisguindon.github.io.git
cd chrisguindon.github.io
npm install
hugo
```
